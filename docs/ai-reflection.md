# AI & GitHub Copilot Reflection

During this assignment, I used AI-assisted tools such as ChatGPT (and/or GitHub Copilot) to help understand Git commands, workflows, and documentation structure.

## How AI Helped Me
- Generated example commands and workflows faster
- Helped write README, CONTRIBUTING, and wiki content clearly
- Clarified Git concepts like merge conflicts and pull requests
- Guided me step-by-step through GitHub features

## My Learning
I still manually verified everything, ran commands myself, and understood each step. AI improved my speed and understanding, but I did the actual work.

## Conclusion
AI was a helpful assistant—not a replacement for my learning—and made the assignment more efficient and organized.
